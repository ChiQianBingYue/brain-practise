Description
Given a set of positive integers, write a function to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

Example
Given nums = [1, 6, 11, 5], return 1

// Subset1 = [1, 5, 6], sum of Subset1 = 12 
// Subset2 = [11], sum of Subset2 = 11   
// abs(11 - 12) = 1     

Ideal

Use boolean dp[i] to mark if one set in nums can added to i,
then we only need to find dp[i] is true and sum of nums - i is minnimal.

To get dp[i], we get number from nums one by one, from left to right. For 
each number n, we test if dp[j - n], where sum >= j >= n, is True, if yes,
then dp[j] is True. We don't want duplicate count of n, so we start from right
to left.
